# prject template

this is a nice simple empty c++ project template

## why

so every time I want to do something i dont have to mkdir ... cd ... etc.

## how

assuming your using some linux-y thing and can run .sh files,

just run the .sh file in the directory that you want the project to be run in
(and pass the projects name as an arg to the .sh file ex: build.sh folder_name_here)

you can build and run the stuff with the make file

### or if your on windows or some shit

idk! clone the repo or something

#### ps make sure u have cmake or smt


# I stole the makefile from github, idk where from but it works
